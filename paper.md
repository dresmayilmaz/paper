# Introduction
We are looking for a simple and versetile way to control the final microstructure of EBCs.

Using different process parameters, the particle size is controlled, changing the packing density of green coatings (Yilmaz, 2022).

Paksoy et al (2023) showed the importance of top coat density on TGO formation. 

Since TGO is one of the most common failure modes in EBCs, reducing the growth rate is a good stragety to increase the lifetime.

# Simulations

We simulate how particle size impact packing density.

# Methodology

Electrophoretic deposition is applied following to the previous published paper (Yilmaz, 2022) but deposition parameters are varied.

Simulations - Pyhton

Scanning electron microscopy for microstructural analysis

Confocal for roughness analysis

# Results

The simulations and experimental results match with each other, showing that lower applied voltages follow the theoratical trend for packing density.
